As I stated before on previuos reviews working on a readme while the project is incomplete goes against my workflow. And Readmes are mandatory only for complete projects.
I will implement the readme when the curriculum ask me to or when I submit the final milestone.

Please keep your observations on the README as optional since I'm following the curriculum by the letter. Thanks.
