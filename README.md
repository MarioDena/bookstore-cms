As I stated before on previuos reviews working on a readme while the project is incomplete goes against my workflow. And Readmes are mandatory only for complete projects.
I will implement the readme when the curriculum ask me to or when I submit the final milestone.

Please keep your observations on the README as optional since I'm following the curriculum by the letter. Thanks.

Magic-books Inc. is a fictional company based in Germany. They have requested your help to build the front-end of an application that will help them organize and manage their bookstore. They want it to be fast, dynamic and responsive to their actions and therefore you decided to build it with React & Redux.
